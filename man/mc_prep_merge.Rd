\title{Merge myClim objects}
\usage{
mc_prep_merge(data_items)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_items}{list of myClim objects in Raw-format or Agg-format see \link{myClim-package}; Format of merged objects must be same.}
}
\value{
merged myClim object in the same format as input objects
}
\description{
This function is designed to merge myClim objects into one.
}
\details{
This function works only when the input myClim objects have the same format (Raw-format, Agg-format) and the same time step.
It is required same step in Agg-format data.

When the two merged myClim objects in Raw-format contains locality with same names (locality_id),
than list of loggers are merged on the locality. Sensors with the same name does not matter here.
Loggers with the same name are allowed in the Raw-format.

When the two merged myClim objects in Agg-format contains locality with same names (locality_id).
than the sensors are merged on the locality. Sensors with same names are renamed.

merged_data <- mc_prep_merge(list(mc_data_example_source, mc_data_example_source))
